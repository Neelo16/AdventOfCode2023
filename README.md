# Advent of Code 2023

This repo contains my solutions to the 2023 edition of [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
Most days were implemented in Rust, as I like to use this event to learn new languages, but the last
few days were implemented in Python, as Christmas was approaching and I wanted to finish the event despite
being busy with other things.
